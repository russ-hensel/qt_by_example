# qt_by_example

The plan for this is to have a small number of applications that illustrate the
use of many of qt's widgets.  It grew out of my efforts to learn qt.  I use it
as a place to first test out code I think I understand and then experiment a bit
with it.  It may be useful to have two versions, one close to this distribution
and one for expermentations.

This repo currently contains a version of wat ( see... ) that runs as a GUI
application.  This is used by other Qt by example apps, but is used by them.
You may be interested in it even if you are not interested in the rest of this
repo.  It does run in qt, so you need to have qt installed.  You do not
need to run it in a qt app of your own, but you can if you wish.  I will
try to add some material in the wiki.

The applications should be simple and contain code that is closely linked to the
appearance of the widgets.

The code should also be copy and paste ready for other to paste into thier application.

Currently the apps run but are in a fairly sad state.

Whatch for updates and for postings here of any overall change in status.

Status:import gui_qt_ext
    A bit sad, but not so sad as it was.
    Some percentage of dead code, some waiting for integration
    Repo may be incomplete, but I think will work, let me know.
    I am doing a lot of development on it, it is a moving target
    that shoud be improving quite a bit untill I get into another 
    project.

To run:
    No install, just download and run from your development environment.
    Needs qt5 and wat
        wat may be found at:     igrek51/wat: Deep inspection of Python objects
                                 https://github.com/igrek51/wat

    Try running 
        * qt_widgets.py
        * qt_sql_widgets.py


And yes i should learn github markup
