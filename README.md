# qt_by_example  
    which qt, for now QT5 for Python

The Plan ( some implemented ! )

The plan for this is to have a small number of applications that illustrate the
use of many of qt's widgets.  It grew out of my efforts to learn qt.  I use it
as a place to first test out code I think I understand and then experiment a bit
with it.  It may be useful to have two versions, one close to this distribution
and one for expermentations.

Wat in a QT GUI:

This repo currently contains a version of wat ( see qt_wat.py and qt_wat_app.py ) 
that runs wat as a GUI application.  
This is used a lot by other Qt by example apps.
You may be interested in it even if you are not interested in the rest of this
repo.  It does run in qt, so you need to have qt installed.  You do not
need to run it in a qt app of your own, but you can if you wish.  I will
try to add some material in the wiki.

Back to the Examples:

The application's code should be simple and contain code that is closely linked to the
appearance of the widgets so that it is easy to find.  One wat to find it
is to use the break button found on all the tabs, this will break into the
debugger in the tab page you are viewing.

The code is the examples should be "copy and paste ready" so you can copy it
into your application, tweak it anf be off and running.

Whatch for updates and for postings here of any overall change in status.

Status: 
    A bit sad, but not so sad as it was.
    Some percentage of dead code, some waiting for integration
    Repo may be incomplete, but I think will work, let me know.
    I am doing a lot of development on it, it is a moving target
    that shoud be improving quite a bit untill I get into another 
    project.

To run:
    No install, just download and run from your development environment.
    Needs qt5 and wat
        wat may be found at:     igrek51/wat: Deep inspection of Python objects
                                 https://github.com/igrek51/wat

    Try running 
        * qt_widgets.py
        * qt_sql_widgets.py
        for wat alone
        * qt_wat.pya_wat_function
        * qt_wat_app.py    
        


And yes i should learn github markup
