# qt_by_example

The plan for this is to have a small number of applications that illustrate the
use of many of qt's widgets.

The applications should be simple and contain code that is closely linked to the
appearance of the widgets.

The code should also be copy and paste ready for other to paste into thier application.

Currently the apps run but are in a fairly sad state.

Whatch for updates and for postings here of any overall change in status.

Status:import gui_qt_ext
    A bit sad, but not so sad as it was.
    Some percentage of dead code, some waiting for integration
    Repo may be incomplete, but I think will work, let me know.
    I am doing a lot of development on it, it is a moving target
    that shoud be improving quite a bit untill I get into another 
    project.

To run:
    No install, just download and run from your development environment.
    Needs qt5 and wat
