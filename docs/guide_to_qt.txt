What is the relationship between  QAbstractTableModel QTableWidget  QTableView, and
what is the appropriate use for each?

Here's an explanation of the relationships between QAbstractTableModel, QTableWidget, and QTableView, along with their appropriate uses:
1. QAbstractTableModel

QAbstractTableModel is part of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework in Qt. It is an abstract base class that defines the interface for custom table models. You subclass it to create your own model for managing and presenting tabular data.
Key Characteristics:

    Provides flexibility for custom data sources.
    You must implement key methods like rowCount(), columnCount(), data(), and optionally others like setData() and flags() for editability.
    Works independently of any specific view.
    Can be used with any view (e.g., QTableView, QListView) via the MVC architecture.

Appropriate Use:

    When you need to display data that doesn't come from a standard structure like a database or a simple list.
    For large datasets or when data is dynamically generated or fetched from a source (e.g., a server or custom data structure).
    When you need full control over how data is accessed and modified.

2. QTableWidget

QTableWidget is a convenience class for simple use cases of displaying a table. It is a subclass of QTableView but comes with its own built-in data model (QTableWidgetItem).
Key Characteristics:

    Easy to use for small, static datasets or simple applications.
    Manages its data internally through QTableWidgetItem.
    Does not follow the MVC architecture strictly (it's tightly coupled with its internal data model).

Appropriate Use:

    When you need a simple table for smaller applications or quick prototypes.
    For situations where you don't need to separate data and presentation logic.
    When working with data that doesn't require advanced features like custom models or external data sources.

3. QTableView

QTableView is a generic table view in the MVC framework. It works with a data model (QAbstractTableModel or its derivatives) to display tabular data. It is more flexible and powerful than QTableWidget.
Key Characteristics:

    Requires a separate model (e.g., QAbstractTableModel or QSqlTableModel) to manage the data.
    Provides more customization for data presentation and interaction.
    Ideal for large datasets and when integrating with other parts of the Qt MVC ecosystem.

Appropriate Use:

    When using external data sources like databases or custom structures (e.g., with QSqlTableModel).
    For applications needing flexibility, such as complex table interactions or visualizations.
    For large datasets where the separation of data and view is beneficial.

Summary of Use Cases
Class	Use Case
QAbstractTableModel	When you need full control over data access and presentation, particularly for complex or custom data sources.
QTableWidget	For quick setups or simple tables where separating data and presentation logic isn't necessary.
QTableView	When you need a flexible and scalable solution for displaying tabular data, especially when backed by a QAbstractTableModel or similar.
Relationships:

    QTableWidget is a subclass of QTableView, with an internal model (QTableWidgetItem).
    QTableView is a generic table view that works with any model implementing QAbstractTableModel or derived classes.
    QAbstractTableModel provides the foundation for custom models, which QTableView and other views use to display data.

By choosing the appropriate class based on your needs, you can balance simplicity, flexibility, and power in your application.
