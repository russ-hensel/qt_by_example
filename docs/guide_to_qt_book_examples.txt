Martin ( Dr. Fitzpatrick ):

I would like to draw your attention to a python module: qt_fitz_book.py
that I wrote and can be found on the web at:

        russ-hensel/qt_by_example: Examples of how qt widgets work
        https://github.com/russ-hensel/qt_by_example

The particular app is fairly small but embedded in a lot of other code,
I think if you get the whole repo. Then qt_fitz_book.py should run.

( this is not install, just download, and run from an environment where qt5 is installed )

I write you about this because it is base strongly on your code examples
and some reading of your qt5 book.

I think this all falls under fair use as the code is at least modestly transformed
but I would still be interest of you opinion about it in a number of respects:

    -- do you feel this violates your interests, legally or morally?
    -- would you care to see more?
    -- the project is too big for me, is it ok if I invite others including on your forum?

If you do not mind more work in this direction, there are a host of other details
that may be of interest:

        -- who is Russ H?
        -- why is it code the way it is?
        -- what is the larger point, if any?

-- who is Russ H

    Old time programmer, Fortran in 1963, professional in SQLWindows and
    Java at the end.  Been messing with Python since 2000 as a very part
    time hobby.  Have other interests.  Retired from working for others.

-- why is the code the way it is?

    I code for myself, so either this it is the way I like it or I am too
    ignorant to know any better ( often I do know better but I do it this way because )
    If I worked with other I would do it differently, how about an immediate
    application of black of similar.  More reasons, buts lets be brief.
    And I know this code needs a lot more work.

-- what is the larger point, if any?

    I am a teacher from way back ( and 10 years teaching High School ) so there
    is a teaching aspect in much of what I do.  Often this is teaching myself
    but I would also like to share.

    I use an apps like this ( see qt_examples.py and qt_sql_examples.py ) as ways
    of teaching myself aspects of Python and trying to make sure they work.
    I try to make "copy and paste" ready code that I can move into my "real"
    work with minimum editing.  Again there is more, but again I am keeping
    it brief.

So in conclusion:

        What do you think?
        Any advice?
        Would you like to communicate more?
