---- Purpose/Functionality--------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the widgets on this tab we can do full select and update cycles on single tables but
while see it join with a second table.

    * Primary widgets

The code is found in  QSqlRelationalTableModelTab and focus on the use of  QSqlRelationalTableModel  and QTableView.

    * <select_all> selects all the records with the join

    * <select_some> selects some the records see the code and console output

    * <insert_record> what it says see the code and console output

    *Inspect <inspect>
        the usual

    *Breakpoint <breakpoint>
        the usual

---- Discussion

    in the relational model there is a primary table ( here people ) and a secondary table ( here people_phones )
    the relational model can do an update, but only on the primary table.  So to add a phone number to a person we
    need to add to people_phones and this is the wrong join for this.  So perhaps do another tab the other way around?


---- Questions

        can we do the join the other way around
