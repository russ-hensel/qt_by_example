---- Purpose/Functionality --------------------------------------------------------------------------

With the widgets on this tab we can do full select and update cycles on single tables at a time
or coordiant actions on multiple tables by using multiple widgets.

A note on sql widgets.

    In pyqt using widgets we usually have 2 ( or more ) cooperating widgets.  One is an
    ORM and interacts with the database, it is often called a "Model".  It is not visual and does not interact with
    the user.  The second widget ( or set of widgets ) is visual and interacts with the user in
    the case of this tab it is called a "View".

    So to use these we normally connect one widget to another.  There are many ways of doing
    this.  So far in this set of examples I have only done the simplest.  -- I should write a
    little guide to the methods I have used so far. --- What this example does is connect an
    sql data access widger or orm to a sql view.  To be precise a QSqlTableModel   and a
    QTableView the connection is in the code: "view.setModel( model  )"


The code is found in QSqlTableModelTab and focus on the use of QSqlTableModel and QTableView

---- Widget Creation --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    see _build_gui as usual, with the sql widget build in _build_model

        of note

            set up the update method
            set up clicked behaviour
            set headers
            control column visibility
            read it....


---- User interaction --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Clicking on a row in the people table  widget   causes a reselect in the people_phones widget
        this is somewhat like a join of the two tables

        that is the id of the person ( column 0 ) is used to select rows in the people_phones.person_id



    I have 
        view                    = QTableView( )
 
        view.setSelectionBehavior( QTableView.SelectRows )
     from a program how do i get the selected rows



    Buttons:

        * <select_all> selects all the records in both tables

        *Inspect <inspect>
            the usual

        *Breakpoint <breakpoint>
            the usual


---- Questions

        can we do the join the other way around

---- Work still to do  --------------------------------------------------------------------------
