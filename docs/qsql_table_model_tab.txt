see also Qt CheatSheet - BD_USD_SSD_WIKI
http://bulldog/mediawiki/index.php/Qt_CheatSheet#QSqlTableView

this has a one to many relation in the data and the views when clicke on try to coordinate them

you can see a bunch of setup for the QSqlTable model and view some of which it the same
as other Widgets

righ now acccess is by ix_col and ix_row, but there mry be records or whole rows hidden in here
time and exploration will tell



this has 2 models and 2 views thru 2 related tables

we have some inspection and some actions if you click on the top view


there is a lot more to do here, like add and delete records


the sample db should be used on all tabs and have its own tab
to make the samples easier to use
