This is the general help  -- do some consistent version with qt_sql ......


This is a little app to demonstrate in a compact way the code used for pyqt Graphical User Interface Widgets.


Use of widges involves several different programming aspects:

    Widget creatation and the setting of widget properties.  These
    properties govern widget appearance and behavior.

    Connection widget events to actions

    Reading of widget state, getting information about the widgets.

    Placement of the widgets on windows.

All of this involves a lot of code.  We will illustrate as much of it
as we have energy for, hopefully what is here will be useful to you.

The widgets have been divided into group that are shown on an individual
tab.  Some tabs illustrate more than one type of widget.  In some cases
a single widget may be shown on more than one tab.

Each tab is itself a descandant of QWidget and coded in its own class.
Hopefully this keep the code for a single widget in a fairly small easy
to understand space.

Of course to illustrate the use of widgets we need to use some widget
to "hold" our illustrations.  This code may also be of use.  For example
the construstion of tabs is illustrated by the framework of this application


Overall App Illustrates:
    Illustrates:
        A main window  ( code in: QtWidgetExamplesInTabs or whatever i decide is a better name )
        TabNotebook with a lot of individual tabs
            Tabs show the ability to create, name, move, and close
            plus other stuff shown in the code.





Individual Tabs:

    Each illustrates one or more widgets in a Tab.  Tabs are implemented as individual classes
    to make the code easy to search.

    Each tab is documented internally by comments, by text printed to the console when you
    interact with the tab, and by a text file document, like this, for each tab.

    Most tabs have buttons for:

        Mutating the objects.

        Inspecting the objects.
        Breakpoint, breaking into the debugger in the objects code.





Reading the code:

    Since these are gui elements much of the info you need will be found in the widget method
    build_gui

    I sometimes have a Search comment at the top of the code to help you find code of interest







            Try them, and read the docs for more information.




Code Style

    The code style is formatted the way i like it, far from PEP 8, run black... on it if you want.

    The style is a bit pedantic, some code could be more compact, I am going for clarity here.

    I have tried to use good names.... to make the code friendly to cut and paste...
